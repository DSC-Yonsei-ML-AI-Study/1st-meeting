## What is Machine Learning
> Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task **without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.** It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence...

 즉, 사람이 일일이 명령(프로그램)하지 않고, 데이터, 패턴 또는 직관(?)에 따라 일을 수행하는 알고리즘 또는 통계적 모델을 말한다.



## Rule-Based Learning ?
> Rule-based machine learning (RBML) is a term in computer science intended to encompass any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves 'rules' to store, manipulate or apply.[1][2][3] The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learner is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learners that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.[clarification needed][citation needed]
Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems,[4] association rule learning,[5] artificial immune systems,[6] and any other method that relies on a set of rules, each covering contextual knowledge.
While rule-based machine learning is conceptually a type of rule-based system, it is distinct from traditional rule-based systems, which are often hand-crafted, and other rule-based decision makers. This is because rule-based machine learning applies some form of learning algorithm to automatically identify useful rules, rather than a human needing to apply prior domain knowledge to manually construct rules and curate a rule set.
